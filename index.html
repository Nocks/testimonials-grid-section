              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
              current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel
              I got every penny’s worth.

              &quot; I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
              I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people
              who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
              Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
              working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. &quot;

              &quot; Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
              code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
              learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
              The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
              hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
              project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
              the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
              I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
              experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
              developer after receiving multiple offers.
              100% recommend! &quot;
